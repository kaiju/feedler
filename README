An RSS plugin for the Deluge torrent client with regular expression matching and targeted directories.

This evolved out of code for a utility I wrote that did the same thing w/ rtorrent over XML-RPC. I switched to Deluge for my torrenting needs and I figured this would be a good introduction to writing Deluge plugins.

Depends on feedparser (http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/)
